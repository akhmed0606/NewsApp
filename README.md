* #### _New York Times_ API

In order to fetch data from the _New York Times_ API, you'll need to make calls to the following URL: `http://api.nytimes.com/svc/news/v3/content/all/all.json`

In addition to making calls to these URLs, you will need to request an API key from [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/signup). Once you have the key, you will "sign" your requests by attaching the key to the URL like so:
```
http://api.nytimes.com/svc/news/v3/content/all/all.json?api-key=<your key here>
```
